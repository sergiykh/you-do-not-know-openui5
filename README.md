# Introduction

A goal of my [blog](https://blogs.sap.com/author/skholod/) is do not teach you how to use [openui5 library from SAP](http://openui5.org/) in right way. The openui5 was designed to solve one issue with several possible ways. So you are able to choose.

The goal is sharing my personal experience of using the library and some other web development stuff, which helps you to speed up your development using openui5.

All code samples are developed on MacOS environment. On other environments (Linux or Windows) process should be nearly the same.

## Pre-requirements

Minimal:

 - MacOS, Linux or Windows operating system prepared
 - [Chromium browser](https://www.chromium.org/) installed
 - [Node.js javascript runtime](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
 - [Yarn dependency manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed
 - [Gulp4 javascript task runner](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0) installed globally

Additional:

 - [Git client](https://git-scm.com/) (command-line or GUI) installed
 - Preferred IDE installed (for ex. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/))
